# Introduction 

Welcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.

# Project Overview

As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. 

# Data Source

There are three files in the data folder: `airbnb_price.csv`, `airbnb_room_type.xlsx`, `airbnb_last_review.tsv`.

Recall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. 
Three files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:

**data/airbnb_price.csv**

This is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.

- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing
- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD
- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located

**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**

This is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.

- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing
- **`description`**: listing description
- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments

**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**

This is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.

- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing
- **`host_name`**: name of listing host
- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.

- What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.
- How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.
- What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.
- Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called `review_dates` with four columns in the following order: `first_reviewed`, `last_reviewed`, `nb_private_rooms`, and `avg_price`. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.

# Data Analysis

```{python}
# Import necessary packages
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import the datasets
airbnb_price = pd.read_csv("data/airbnb_price.csv")
airbnb_room = pd.read_excel("data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx")
airbnb_last_review = pd.read_csv("data/airbnb_last_review.tsv", sep='\t')

# Merging the three DataFrames
price_room_review = pd.merge(pd.merge(airbnb_price, airbnb_room, on='listing_id', how='inner'), airbnb_last_review, on='listing_id', how='inner')

# Converting reviews data to a date format
price_room_review['last_review'] = pd.to_datetime(price_room_review['last_review'], errors='coerce')

# Dates of the earliest and most recent reviews
fir_reviewed = price_room_review['last_review'].min()
las_reviewed = price_room_review['last_review'].max()

print(f"Earliest review date: {fir_reviewed}")
print(f"Most recent review date: {las_reviewed}")

# Deal with Value inconsistency in room_type column
price_room_review['room_type'] = price_room_review['room_type'].str.lower()

# Number of listings that are private rooms
pvt_room = price_room_review[price_room_review['room_type'] == 'private room'].shape[0]

print(f"Number of private room listings: {pvt_room}")

# Alternative Method: Using value_counts()

# Get the count of each room type
nb_private_room = price_room_review['room_type'].value_counts()

# Display the number of listings that are private rooms
print(f"Number of private room listings: {nb_private_room.get('private room', 0)}")

# The average listing price? Round to the nearest 2 decimal places.
# Firstly, convert to float from strings
price_room_review['price'] = price_room_review['price'].str.strip('dollars') 
price_room_review['price'] = price_room_review['price'].astype('float')

# Average listing price
mid_price = round(price_room_review['price'].mean(), 2)

print(f"The average listing pice: {mid_price}")

# Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates
review_date = {'first_reviewed': [fir_reviewed], 'last_reviewed': [las_reviewed], 'nb_private_rooms': [pvt_room], 'avg_price': [mid_price]}

review_dates = pd.DataFrame(review_date)

print(review_dates)
```

# Result/Findings

The Analysis results are summarize as follows:

- The earliest review date was 1st January 2019.
- The most recent review date was 9th July 2019. 
- The number of private rooms listings are `{python} pvt_room`.
- The average listing price is `{python} mid_price`
- The one row DataFrame is `{python} review_date`
