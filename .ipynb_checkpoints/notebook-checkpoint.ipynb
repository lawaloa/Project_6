{"cells":[{"source":"![NYC Skyline](nyc.jpg)\n\nWelcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.\n\nRecall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \nThree files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n\n**data/airbnb_price.csv**\nThis is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n\n**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\nThis is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`description`**: listing description\n- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n\n**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\nThis is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"c747d469-ee97-4b95-880f-feefd5456042","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import the datasets\nairbnb_price = pd.read_csv(\"data/airbnb_price.csv\")\nairbnb_room = pd.read_excel(\"data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx\")\nairbnb_last_review = pd.read_csv(\"data/airbnb_last_review.tsv\", sep='\\t')\n\n# Merging the three DataFrames\nprice_room_review = pd.merge(pd.merge(airbnb_price, airbnb_room, on='listing_id', how='inner'), airbnb_last_review, on='listing_id', how='inner')\n\n# Converting reviews data to a date format\nprice_room_review['last_review'] = pd.to_datetime(price_room_review['last_review'], errors='coerce')\n\n# Dates of the earliest and most recent reviews\nfir_reviewed = price_room_review['last_review'].min()\nlas_reviewed = price_room_review['last_review'].max()\n\nprint(fir_reviewed)\nprint(las_reviewed)\n\n# Deal with Value inconsistency in room_type column\nprice_room_review['room_type'] = price_room_review['room_type'].str.lower()\n\n# Number of listings that are private rooms\npvt_room = price_room_review[price_room_review['room_type'] == 'private room'].shape[0]\n\nprint(f\"Number of private room listings: {pvt_room}\")\n\n# Alternative Method: Using value_counts()\n\n# Get the count of each room type\nnb_private_room = price_room_review['room_type'].value_counts()\n\n# Display the number of listings that are private rooms\nprint(f\"Number of private room listings: {nb_private_rooms.get('private room', 0)}\")\n\n# The average listing price?
